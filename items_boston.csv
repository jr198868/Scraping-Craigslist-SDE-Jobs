        ,
We are a four-year-old medical technology company founded by a team of accomplished entrepreneurs that have built multiple successful, multi-million dollar companies, including two that we took public on the NASDAQ.  ,
This company is growing rapidly and has been well funded, having raised $14.5 million dollars to date.  ,
,
We have created and patented a revolutionary orthopedic rehabilitation device.  Response to the new device has been very strong, with endorsement by 126 highly respected surgeons nationwide.  First versions of the device have been sold into more than 75 hospitals and clinics including many of the top 20 organizations in the country.  ,
,
We are now nearing completion of our second product, a portable version of our first flagship device.  A growing list of surgeons are pre-ordering the product in anticipation of launch this spring.,
,
The new product features wearable devices for measuring and tracking patient progress.,
,
We are now seeking a full-time VP of Engineering (near Boston or surrounding area), with a proven track record of successfully bringing new medical devices from specs to market. This person will report directly to our CEO and manage a small team of mechanical, electrical, and software engineers, industrial designers, and fabricators which will turn pictures, drawings, specs, illustrations, directions and requirements into a working, market-ready device; and hand it off to manufacturing.,
,
The company is located in western Connecticut.  This candidate must be located either in Boston or western Connecticut, or nearby enough that they can easily commute there for meetings.  Alternatively the company will consider relocating a very qualified candidate.,
,
The current product is being finalized and tested for market readiness.  Another device is in early stages of engineering, and there are multiple additional products planned behind these.  For the right candidate, there are likely to be many years of engineering work ahead.,
,
The desired candidate will oversee and manage each contributing engineer on timelines and budgets. The VP of Engineering drives the planning, design, prototyping, testing, and refinement of product development.,

,
The ideal candidate has:,
,
 an entrepreneurial, “guerilla warfare” mindset and style, i.e. builds things fast and cheap and demonstrates them quickly, versus big-company-big-budget-long-timeline; ,
an extreme sense of urgency; ,
a high level of creativity and a vast knowledge of a wide variety of materials and methods of solving engineering problems; ,
an ability to plan activities and processes in parallel; ,
and a positive “get it done” “this will be easy” attitude; ,
combining to push projects to completion at rapid speed.,
The candidate should be familiar with and operate with lean and agile best practices with frequent builds, and with creating a minimum viable product as first priority.,
,
The Engineering Manager will need to:,
,
Assess proposals and identify any additional partners/consultants needed for key aspects of the design, testing, and manufacturing processes,
Manage diverse teams of engineers and designers,
Keep detailed and accurate records,
Cooperate with and support quality management system for regulatory requirements,
Use your experience and expertise to take the lead while remaining flexible enough to implement and adapt to feedback and requirements from management and advisors,
Continue building a strong, lean, and talented Engineering team through the development of internal talent as well as external hiring,
Build multiple teams over time for various projects, yet share intelligence between teams.,
,
Key Requirements:,
10+ years of experience engineering products,
Experience in medical devices, orthopedics, medical background / training / anatomy, medical regulatory agencies and procedures, are all a plus but not required,
Can demonstrate past success moving products from concept to market,
Ability to work well under pressure to meet aggressive deadlines,
Skilled at reading, processing, and working with technical writing and data,
Ability to interface effectively with engineers to complete work and achieve targets,
Experience using product management software, including ability to quickly learn how to use new management software,
,
Qualified candidates, please respond and include:,
A cover letter detailing why you are the ideal fit for this job and your current pay requirements,
An up-to-date resume,
A list of devices (medical or otherwise) which you have personally successfully led the charge in engineering from specs to showroom ,
,
Please respond to this post only. Do not contact the company via phone or email outside of this post. ,
,
For the right candidate, this is a long-term position with tremendous growth potential.  Compensation is competitive and is based on experience, accomplishments, and proven success.  The company is willing to compensate in the upper range for a candidate who demonstrate extraordinary productivity over time.,
,
Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.,

an ability to plan activities and processes in parallel; ,
and a positive “get it done” “this will be easy” attitude; ,
combining to push projects to completion at rapid speed.,
The candidate should be familiar with and operate with lean and agile best practices with frequent builds, and with creating a minimum viable product as first priority.,
,
The Engineering Manager will need to:,

Continue building a strong, lean, and talented Engineering team through the development of internal talent as well as external hiring,
Build multiple teams over time for various projects, yet share intelligence between teams.,
,
Key Requirements:,
10+ years of experience engineering products,

Can demonstrate past success moving products from concept to market,

For the right candidate, this is a long-term position with tremendous growth potential.  Compensation is competitive and is based on experience, accomplishments, and proven success.  The company is willing to compensate in the upper range for a candidate who demonstrate extraordinary productivity over time.,
,
Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.,
