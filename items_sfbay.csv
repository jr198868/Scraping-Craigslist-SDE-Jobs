        ,
Do you love to convince people to take action and leverage resources for the greater good? Do you love to tell a good story? Are you amazingly talented at keeping track of all kinds of tiny details? Do you want to be challenged, learn a ton of skills, be on the cutting edge of economic justice work, have a good laugh, brainstorm a lot, get frustrated sometimes but inspired frequently, and be on the right side of history?,
,
MAF is looking for a Philanthropy Manager who wants an opportunity to learn and develop within an organization that has a great reputation and leads with big ideas. The Manager will be joining a thriving Fundraising Team, handling important details necessary to a well-functioning department. You’ll bring analytic and project management skills to round out a dynamic team dedicated to philanthropy who are skilled writers and communicators including our CEO, Engagement Manager, Development Coordinator, and grant writer. MAF intends to invest in the professional development of this position so that they can grow and develop, gaining increasing levels of responsibility and opportunity over time.,
,
,
Our story: In this political climate, the need to pivot quickly and be responsive to the needs of low-income and immigrant communities is crucial. This fall, MAF’s Fundraising team took on a big, hairy, audacious goal: quickly fundraise to help Dreamers in the wake of the presidential administration’s attempt to end the program. And that we did. We raised over $4M in 24 days - doubling the amount of our operating budget. It was nothing short of amazing. It meant bringing on brand new exciting funders, people thrilled about our work and our mission, and lots of opportunity and growth. ,
,
Mission Asset Fund (MAF) is a groundbreaking non-profit on a mission to create a fair financial marketplace for hardworking families. We’re a recognized nationwide leader in developing innovative and successful asset-building strategies. A hybrid between a tech start-up and a nonprofit, MAF is a great place to work for both nonprofit or for-profit professionals who are interested in tech for social good.,
,
As MAF grows, we need a passionate Philanthropy Manager who can work with our team to shape the future of our organization. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants not just a job, but also an opportunity to build the financial power in communities of color and be part of a community and culture that is committed to social good. ,
,
An awesome place to work: We’re right in the middle of the Mission District in San Francisco, it’s awesome here, with diverse restaurants, bars, and shops. We’ve got great team outings (fighting zombies, putt-putt and bowling to name a few). And the team is ridiculously dedicated to the mission and fun to work with. Plus, you’ll get to hobnob with a certified MacArthur Genius and learn from him every day. (It also helps that we have the best snacks.) We have a super beautiful office setting, with lots of bright colors and natural light. As a nonprofit and tech startup, we attract people who like to jump in with both feet and who aren’t afraid of learning how to do better. With an open office environment, collaboration and teamwork are more than just values - they’re a way of life. Hailing from many different cultural and professional backgrounds, we are drawn together by a passion for embracing technology and creativity to make the world a better place for hardworking families.,

        ,
Do you love to convince people to take action and leverage resources for the greater good? Do you love to tell a good story? Are you amazingly talented at keeping track of all kinds of tiny details? Do you want to be challenged, learn a ton of skills, be on the cutting edge of economic justice work, have a good laugh, brainstorm a lot, get frustrated sometimes but inspired frequently, and be on the right side of history?,
,
MAF is looking for a Philanthropy Manager who wants an opportunity to learn and develop within an organization that has a great reputation and leads with big ideas. The Manager will be joining a thriving Fundraising Team, handling important details necessary to a well-functioning department. You’ll bring analytic and project management skills to round out a dynamic team dedicated to philanthropy who are skilled writers and communicators including our CEO, Engagement Manager, Development Coordinator, and grant writer. MAF intends to invest in the professional development of this position so that they can grow and develop, gaining increasing levels of responsibility and opportunity over time.,
,
,
Our story: In this political climate, the need to pivot quickly and be responsive to the needs of low-income and immigrant communities is crucial. This fall, MAF’s Fundraising team took on a big, hairy, audacious goal: quickly fundraise to help Dreamers in the wake of the presidential administration’s attempt to end the program. And that we did. We raised over $4M in 24 days - doubling the amount of our operating budget. It was nothing short of amazing. It meant bringing on brand new exciting funders, people thrilled about our work and our mission, and lots of opportunity and growth. ,
,
Mission Asset Fund (MAF) is a groundbreaking non-profit on a mission to create a fair financial marketplace for hardworking families. We’re a recognized nationwide leader in developing innovative and successful asset-building strategies. A hybrid between a tech start-up and a nonprofit, MAF is a great place to work for both nonprofit or for-profit professionals who are interested in tech for social good.,
,
As MAF grows, we need a passionate Philanthropy Manager who can work with our team to shape the future of our organization. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants not just a job, but also an opportunity to build the financial power in communities of color and be part of a community and culture that is committed to social good. ,
,
An awesome place to work: We’re right in the middle of the Mission District in San Francisco, it’s awesome here, with diverse restaurants, bars, and shops. We’ve got great team outings (fighting zombies, putt-putt and bowling to name a few). And the team is ridiculously dedicated to the mission and fun to work with. Plus, you’ll get to hobnob with a certified MacArthur Genius and learn from him every day. (It also helps that we have the best snacks.) We have a super beautiful office setting, with lots of bright colors and natural light. As a nonprofit and tech startup, we attract people who like to jump in with both feet and who aren’t afraid of learning how to do better. With an open office environment, collaboration and teamwork are more than just values - they’re a way of life. Hailing from many different cultural and professional backgrounds, we are drawn together by a passion for embracing technology and creativity to make the world a better place for hardworking families.,

,
NOT WANTED,
Resumes, solo / cowboy programmers, NIH attitude,
,
YOUR MONDAY,
Monday morning you wake up, maybe have some coffee and breakfast, drag a comb across your head, and read through your email and Slack messages. You review the issues in our sprint backlog, as you get ready for our weekly 9:00am sprint planning meeting by hangout, which you attend in your pajamas. Maybe we play some planning poker to refine our estimates. After about an hour or so, we lock down the sprint and we're off and running for the week. Maybe you commit to these tasks: (1) writing a new Java servlet to implement a new feature; (2) defending against an attack on our codebase from other programmers, and (3) working closely with one of our customers who runs a top news website, to resolve a JavaScript error we're seeing on their site.,
,
At 11:00am we scheduled a meeting to design a major new feature, so over a hangout and using screen shares as needed, we throw around design ideas, maybe you sketch some user interfaces, and draw out a flowchart or interaction diagram to clarify things. After the meeting, you write up the design and then circulate it for review. Once we finalize it, we'll break it down into stories or tasks in the backlog and schedule those in upcoming sprints.,
,
It's lunch time, and you're done with 2 of your 3 scheduled meetings for the week. The rest of the week, you're up to your elbows in Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, HTML, CSS, and various back end services running on AWS like Lambda Functions, CloudFront, Athena, and QuickSight to name a few.,
,
Now it's 1pm and you're ready to work on that customer issue. You look at the bug report details in Pivotal Tracker, connect into AWS and check our RDS, DynamoDB, and various EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk services to see if any of them are misbehaving. Into the Tomcat logs you go, and what do you spy with your little eye, but a bunch of exceptions and stack traces every time the customer website renders a page. ""Ahah!"" you say, ""The Java code isn't returning valid JSON to the client!"" and you're off and running on a fix. By the end of the day, you have the bug fix completed, and ready to test on our QA servers. Once verified, you check into git, continuous integration does its thing, and we push the change live. This was a good start to the week because fixing that bug directly increased our revenue.,
,
Tomorrow, you'll be using a network analyzer like Fiddler or Charles to examine packets going in and out of our own custom-written proxy server, to figure out why a third party service is returning an error code to the server side of the proxy server, which ultimately ripples back to the client as an error. That'll have you deep into HTTP headers, cookies, content encoding, whether query arguments are encoded properly, and more as you try to figure that one out. That'll be fun.,
,
====,
A WORD FROM YOUR POTENTIAL MANAGER,
I've got 45 years of professional software development experience building some of the most successful and well known software in the world at companies like AT&T, Oracle, and Netflix, as well as numerous startups. This taught me that the best teams emerge when you bring together very talented software developers with the right combination of culture and process, and then something magical happens.,
,
HOW TO APPLY,
Please DO NOT submit a resume. Your application will be turned down if you submit a resume. Instead, please apply by emailing a cover letter, explaining how your background is relevant to this job description, and why we should consider hiring you. You can read more about our business at www.adtoniq.io, and feel free to comment on our business as well. If we think you're a good match, we'll schedule a 90 minute Google Hangout during which we can talk about the position, but the bulk of the time we'll write some code together to see how well we can work together. During the Hangout, you'll be doing the driving and writing the code, but we'll be working together, like pair programming, though that's not usually how we work. If it's a go from both sides after that, we'll have an in person interview in San Francisco where we can explore the details of this position and our company.,

The Application Software Engineer develops the ECL Command Center and the multiple internal applications on which the ECL runs. The Command Center is a desktop application built with web technologies. It offers scientists a broad suite of tools for designing experiments on the ECL, tracking their progress, and analyzing their results, all within the collaborative context of working alongside other researchers. Projects include: the notebook interface to Emerald’s Symbolic Lab Language (SLL); team-based features for managing projects and end-to-end research workflows; point-and-click command builders that onboard users into the capabilities of SLL; building out the platform for running the web application on the desktop.,
,
We’re a small team, which means it is essential for every team member to be ready to take ownership and lead projects. Feature development and proximity to overall UX are both central in this role, so the Application Engineer works very closely alongside the outstanding ECL Design team.,
,
As an early team member helping to build the Engineering team as well as the product, you will also be encouraged to contribute to the software engineering practices we maintain in our own work, and which we bring to ECL as a whole. We strive to be continually critical of our process, cutting cruft and homing in on performance multipliers (such as continuous integration and agile development practices).  ,
,
,
,
Our applications are web apps (React / HTML5 / CSS3) running on the desktop using NW.js, across Windows and Mac OS. Our back-end services are written in Go, and deployed on AWS infrastructure in Docker containers, with container orchestration through Kubernetes. Our source code control is on Github, with integration with Travis CI for continuous testing. The Symbolic Lab Language is written in the Wolfram Language. Our stack is always evolving, and we welcome new ideas and technologies which enhance our ability to deliver incredible software.,
,
The Application Engineering role operates primarily in front-end technologies like React and Redux. More broadly, developing the software to enable cloud-based science is an expansive, diverse challenge. A core component of our job is consistently determining the right tools for the job at hand, and diving in to learn these new technologies along the way.,

,
,
,

The Emerald Cloud Laboratory (ECL) enables life scientists to move out of the lab, and to conduct research entirely from a computer. Stepping away from manual completion of experiments at the bench, scientists on the ECL leverage the remote, automated execution of all standard biology and chemistry experiments in Emerald’s industrial lab facilities, working within a software platform for all stages of research workflows, from experimental design to data analysis.,

Who we are,
Sofar is powered by the dream to build the world’s best ocean data platform. Our team combines expertise in ocean science, technology, and innovation to develop new solutions for ocean exploration and observation. We are a bunch of ocean nerds and keep our offices close to the water (literally).,
,
We’re a scrappy startup that values teamwork, transparency, and innovation.  We maintain a work atmosphere that’s light-hearted and jovial, but when we need to get something done, we can switch gears and move fast.,
,
We are deeply passionate about making ocean data widely available to ocean communities and enthusiasts with powerful tools and visualizations.,
,
Who you are,
You are a problem-solving, self-motivated team-player who wants to see their engineering talents have a direct impact on the success of your team and company.  ,
,
You care most about the success of the greater team and the impact of what we build together.  When somebody is struggling with their part of the project, you are helpful and work with them to get their work across the finish line.  ,
,
When you get up in the morning, you show up for work because you are excited about the people you work with and the projects you’re working on.,
,
The position,
As a senior full stack engineer, you’ll be most heavily engaged with the rest of our software team on a day-to-day basis.  Your projects will vary based on current company priorities - sometimes they shift quickly, but hey, we’re a start-up, that’s expected - and consequently you’ll get a lot of opportunities to work on different technologies, platforms, and layers of our applications.,
,
We have a small fleet of customer facing apps that are in production - spotter dashboard, sofar spotter app, and the trident controller to name a few - and we’ve got a lot more exciting projects in the works that we haven’t made public yet. You’ll get opportunities to apply your engineering talents to all of them and help us build out the supporting infrastructure - think DevOps.  You’ll get ownership of how you write your code (as long as the linter ok’s it) and get to make technical decisions on implementations on all projects you contribute to.,
,
We try to structure our company time with the maker’s schedule in mind - we don’t like to schedule meetings if at all possible.  We’ve implemented a lightweight flavor of a kanban agile environment that only requires attending a daily standup.,
,
As a senior engineer, you’ll get opportunities to demonstrate both technical leadership on our projects as well as being a cultural role model for the team and company.,
