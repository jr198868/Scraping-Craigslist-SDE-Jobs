Here is what some of our cleaners have say about us:,
,
""MINW is a great place to work--great pay, great friendly helpful staff! I've been happy here...!"" ~ Kim,
,
""As a cleaner with MINW, I've been able to have a MUCH better work-life balance. Prior to contracting with them, I had to put my little girl in daycare, both before, and after school. As a single mom, it was devastating, and exhausting! Now I go to all my little girl's school functions, volunteer again, and still have time to be a musician, which is my passion. I make as much as I did in Healthcare, but work HALF the time! I love being an independent worker, while still having the benefit of a team backing me up. I have the best of all worlds, and I won't be leaving for a very long time!"" ~ Kathryn,
,
""Maids in the Northwest gave me HOPE! The opportunity to work for myself and subcontract additional clients from Maids was exactly what I needed. The joy of cleaning was all the therapy I needed. It has been a wonderful experience and the communication between clients, Maids, and myself has been exceptional. Just a really good place to be, when I needed the flexibility and INCOME! What an opportunity to serve in your community and make a living at it too.,
Thank You, ~ Kay,
,
,
""I just wanted to take a moment to say that I have been a sub-contractor with Maid in the Northwest for quite a while. I also sub-contract with another company.,
I will tell you this, the Maids is the best as far as being fair, getting me work and paying me!,
I don't have to worry about someone under bidding me on a job. I have consistently gotten work. They have worked with me to make sure that I am getting what I need.,
The staff is the best... Really!,
If you are thinking about working with the Maids, don't take too long. Just see for yourself how good they are.,
I'm a very satisfied sub-contractor."" ~ Paul,
,
""As a sub-contractor with this company the past 2 years, I have been cleaning clients' homes who appreciate the use of high-quality cleaning services in maintaining their homes. I enjoy the flexibility I have with scheduling cleaning jobs through this company as well as scheduling my own personal clients. The MINW office staff has been especially helpful with scheduling longer-term cleaning clients for me."" ~ Cathie ,
,
""This has been a wonderful partnership for me for the past 14 years! I can sum it up in one word: flexibility! I'm a working musician and this company has been invaluable, because I can simply book cleaning jobs when I want to! That can be very tough in the traditional work world. I book the occasional cleaning job on my own, but the clear majority comes from this company. A very well run, fair company to contract with, staffed by great people! Who could ask for more?!"",

""MINW is a great place to work--great pay, great friendly helpful staff! I've been happy here...!"" ~ Kim,
,
""As a cleaner with MINW, I've been able to have a MUCH better work-life balance. Prior to contracting with them, I had to put my little girl in daycare, both before, and after school. As a single mom, it was devastating, and exhausting! Now I go to all my little girl's school functions, volunteer again, and still have time to be a musician, which is my passion. I make as much as I did in Healthcare, but work HALF the time! I love being an independent worker, while still having the benefit of a team backing me up. I have the best of all worlds, and I won't be leaving for a very long time!"" ~ Kathryn,
,
""Maids in the Northwest gave me HOPE! The opportunity to work for myself and subcontract additional clients from Maids was exactly what I needed. The joy of cleaning was all the therapy I needed. It has been a wonderful experience and the communication between clients, Maids, and myself has been exceptional. Just a really good place to be, when I needed the flexibility and INCOME! What an opportunity to serve in your community and make a living at it too.,
Thank You, ~ Kay,
,
,
""I just wanted to take a moment to say that I have been a sub-contractor with Maid in the Northwest for quite a while. I also sub-contract with another company.,
I will tell you this, the Maids is the best as far as being fair, getting me work and paying me!,
I don't have to worry about someone under bidding me on a job. I have consistently gotten work. They have worked with me to make sure that I am getting what I need.,
The staff is the best... Really!,
If you are thinking about working with the Maids, don't take too long. Just see for yourself how good they are.,
I'm a very satisfied sub-contractor."" ~ Paul,
,
""As a sub-contractor with this company the past 2 years, I have been cleaning clients' homes who appreciate the use of high-quality cleaning services in maintaining their homes. I enjoy the flexibility I have with scheduling cleaning jobs through this company as well as scheduling my own personal clients. The MINW office staff has been especially helpful with scheduling longer-term cleaning clients for me."" ~ Cathie ,
,
""This has been a wonderful partnership for me for the past 14 years! I can sum it up in one word: flexibility! I'm a working musician and this company has been invaluable, because I can simply book cleaning jobs when I want to! That can be very tough in the traditional work world. I book the occasional cleaning job on my own, but the clear majority comes from this company. A very well run, fair company to contract with, staffed by great people! Who could ask for more?!"",

We are looking for a senior software engineer to tackle interesting data storage, access, and presentation problems and mentor others in a collaborative environment.  This is all done in the context of a small but stable software business that values solving customer problems, challenging work, and fulfilling lives outside of work.  Join our team as we find and root out evil on the Internet every day!,
 ,
,
 ,
We have two big challenges: collecting the right data from the web about brand and product content in context and filtering that data down to the specific incidences that are of concern to our customers.  We solve brand protection problems in online content in automated and creative ways.,
 ,
The first piece is a big directed-crawling challenge, as we want to hit the interesting pages without having the resources to crawl the entire web.  This involves interpreting signals to determine whether following a link is likely to be interesting along with a typical spectrum of web crawling concerns.,
 ,
The second piece is filtering the content we find for the customer.  We use primarily heuristic-based solutions today, but expect to increasingly incorporate machine learning and natural language processing for identification of content in the future. For example, we're using machine learning to predict how customers will categorize issues based on their previous reviews. ,
 ,
In some cases, we are also detecting intentionally bad behavior, in a cat and mouse game to discover those bad (though intelligent) actors.,
 ,
Join our team and help to address these challenges while learning cool new technologies!  Grow your career in exploring challenging problem spaces like machine learning, big data and 'simply' writing responsive and elegant software that performs at an enormous scale!  Collaborate with like-minded developers who do all of this while working in a fun and dynamic environment!,
,
,
 ,
All of this data collection and filtering requires intelligent data storage, primarily in non-relational data stores within AWS, including DynamoDB, Redis, and our column-oriented data store on top of S3.  We also use Redshift and Redshift Spectrum (with Parquet/S3).  We use MySQL in RDS for core relational data.   We work in Python - it's a versatile tool. ,
 ,
All of our heavy liftings is done within AWS, leveraging Chef and EC2 Autoscaling groups to handle changing loads without human intervention.,
 ,
We have hired engineers from a variety of different backgrounds and have found that sharp engineers can identify shared concepts and quickly adapt to the new stack, so don't worry if your background does not include some of these technologies.,
