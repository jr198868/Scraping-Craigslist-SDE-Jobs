Our core platforms are built out in a cloud infrastructure in AWS.,
,
,
We like to be open-minded and pragmatic. We use Agile/Scrum to run our teams, but more importantly, we dedicate a lot of effort to team development—making sure teams have the resources and environment most conducive to their success.  ,

We believe that the experiences our applications deliver are critical to the success of our client’s marketing initiatives. The position will help us not only dramatically augment the capacity of our technology platform to deliver experiences at an ever-increasing scale, but also to provide our operators with the tooling needed to onboard and manage a stream of new clients and their needs.,

●     Knowledge of pragmatic engineering practices like iterative releases, test-driven development, continuous integration, and the use of version control systems (Git/GitHub is our primary system, but experience with TFS would be helpful too).,
●     Non-trivial experience with any SQL-based RDBMS (PostgreSQL and SQL*Server experience is especially useful).,
●     Experience with NoSQL data stores (Redis) and asynchronous task processing.,
●     Experience with digital marketing or advertising a plus.,

About the Company:,
As a performance marketing agency, iProspect helps brands uncover new customers and revenue by delivering relevant experiences and connecting data. We’ve built a proprietary technology platform that delivers experiences at each step of a consumer’s journey and collects a rich stream of data to learn what treatments increase the likelihood of a valuable outcome for our clients. We use distributed systems to solve complex compute problems, develop data architectures to support analysis and uncover insights, and use those insights to deliver optimal consumer experiences at scale. Our platform is a high-volume processing system supporting some of the largest companies in the US in ways their internal teams, agencies and IT consultants simply cannot.,

Perks:,
iProspect is a great place to work. We have competitive pay, a matching 401k package, life & disability insurance as well as bonus potential. We focus on education, training and inclusivity on our teams in our day-to-day work, and by encouraging and financially supporting our employees to attend relevant training and conferences. We have a casual environment and strive to maintain a work/life balance, including flexible work scheduling options and parental leave. We moved into a brand-new office space at 515 N. State in Chicago’s River North at the end of May. The Grand and State Red Line stop is right outside the front door and there are lots of great lunch spots within walking distance.,

 ,
,
The real perk of this job is the ability to contribute to a profitable and growing company that strives to give employees the ability to master their craft, increase their skills and be autonomous in their work. We are a small enough division that you can witness and be rewarded for your contributions but are part of large network that allows us to partner with Fortune 100 companies. We support an individual's contribution to the community at large with multiple philanthropic activities and encourage employees to be part of their larger working collective by attending and supporting prominent conferences.,
